This code is the implementation of our paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13414.pdf
To run the Python files which requires the "yfinance" package, run the following command in the terminal:
**pip install yfinance**

Then run the .py file:
**python3 sp500_yfinance_package.py**

That should generate a folder consisting of the required data
